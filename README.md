# Workout-Tracker

I want to create an app that allows a user to create, view, and track daily workout. The user should be able to add mutiple exercises to a workout. The user should be able to add information about the exercises.

- The user should be able to add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
- The user should be able to add new exercises to a new workout plan.
- If the exercise type is resistance, then user should be able to add name, weight, sets, reps, and durations.
- If the exercise type is cardio, then user should be able to add name, distance and, durations
- The user should be able to view combined weight from the past seven workouts on the stats page
- The user should be able to view the duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
